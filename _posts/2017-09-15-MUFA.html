<p>The Madison Ultimate Frisbee Association (MUFA) is one of the largest rec ultimate leagues in the country. I grabbed data about the Summer leagues over the last few years from their registration website.</p>

<h2>Gender imbalance</h2>

<p>Promoting a balanced gender ratio on all the teams is a priority for MUFA. The current rules have a 4-3 men-women ratio on the field. Are teams at least that balanced? It appears that they are, and in an ecouraging sign, the gender ratio appears to be inching closer to parity. We can see this below in a series of boxplots over the past three years. Each box shows the median (green line) and inner 50 percentile (box) along with the inner XXX percentiles (whiskers). The 4-3 ratio is shown as the blue dashed line. New rules changes in the next few years may help bring the gender ratio closer to 1-1.</p>

<p>Within each year we can also look at the distribution of men and women on each team. In general the number of women is tighter distribution (with the majority between five and 10 each year). The distribution of men is more skewed with a large tail to teams with large numbers of men.</p>

<h2>Self Ratings</h2>
Hundreds of teams play throughout the Summer in a swiss tournament. In the beginning of the summer teams rank themselves from 1 through 10. This number is then used to choose who plays eachother throughout the summer. Below we can see the dsitribution of self ratings for the two summer leagues for 2015 through 2017. In each year there is a Monday and Wednesday league, along with a Tuesday and Thursday league.

<h2>Self Ratings vs. Performance Ratings</h2>

<p> The self ratings get turned into a performance rating. This performance rating changes throughout the summer based on wins and loses. We can see a fairly tight correlation between initial self-rating and final performance rating for many years. That said, there appears to be quite a bit of scatter, which is larger in the Monday and Wednesday leagues.</p>

<h2>Self Ratings and Points</h2>

<p> Now lets look at how points the teams earn as a function of self rating. I computed points by using the formula for soccer: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss.</p>

<h2>Performance Ratings and Points</h2>

<p> Similarly lets look at points, but this time by performance rating.</p>

<h2>Change in performance rating over one season</h2>

<p> How much do most teams change in one season?</p>
