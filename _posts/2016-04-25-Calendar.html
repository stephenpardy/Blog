A recent discussion about holidays got me thinking about whether there were any days with no holidays. I scraped the wikipedia entries of each day of the year for the number of holidays, events, births, and deaths. There is remarkable range, especially in the number of births recorded. The day with the fewest births is February 29th  with 109 (maybe not surprising since it happens 1/4 as often as the other days). The most births on a single day is March 27 with 735 births listed.

And what about holidays? The day with the fewest holidays recorded is April 3rd, which has only five Christian feasts.
